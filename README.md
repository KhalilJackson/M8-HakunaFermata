# M8-HakunaFermata

This project is designed to create a music using Sonic Pi then a music video to help the CSCI 2101 students study for their final exam.

The song is titled 'C Through' because it features C chords throughout almost the entirety of the song. The inspiration for the song comes from Ahmad Jamal's song 'I Love Music,' where he quickly switches between C chord major sevenths. Initially, the song was made entirely of piano synths to immulate the Jamal's sounds but eventually became a compilation of sine, hollow, pluck, and piano to diversify the sound and easier indicate the changing states.

The song is composed of five parts: intro, elevation, forty_thousand_feet, descent, and outro. The song begins to mirror itself after the climax in forty_thousand feet. The introdcutions sets a foundation of C chords that it built upon through the songs and returned to in the outro, giving the song a sense of coherence while also allowing it experiment throughout. For a listener, this means they are presented with a recognizable pattern that is transformed through synths, speed, and order before it is returned to at the end.

# Challenges

My primary challenge with this project is making music, because I have no musical expertise or music theory knowledge. So, my first step in working on this project was to work with Professor Harmon to learn a little bit on a piano. Chords, octaves, majors, minors, chords, sevenths, ninths, etc.

Another challenge, almost equally as difficult, was getting through a number of issues I had with Sonic Pi, the distortion of music, shutting down, and recordings being twice the BPM they were suppsoed to. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the chance to make music and put that to a video!
